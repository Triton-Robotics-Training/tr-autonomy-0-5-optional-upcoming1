This is an intermediate assignment to get you to understand how the ROS2 build tools work.

### To complete this assignment:

1. Follow [this tutorial](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html)
2. [Screenshot](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/screen-shot-record.html) the modified turtlesim window you get at the end of the tutorial. Change the window title to say your GitHub username:

> <img src="yourusernamehere.png" style="width: 30%">

3. Commit the screenshot to this repo.
  - To do this, you will need to install git on your Ubuntu machine
    - You can install GitKraken (Pro or Free version, [Pro is free for Students](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-client/gitkraken-edu-pack/)) and use it.
    - Or you can use the command line version of Git. You will need to add your GitHub credentials:
      - I prefer to use the GitHub cli authentication tool
        - [Install](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md)
        - [Login](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_auth_login)
      - Alternatively, you can [use SSH Keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to authenticate
